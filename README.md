Double Dice Game
<h1> Double Dice!</h1>
<p><b>Double Dice</b> is a game where the goal is to roll two dice with the same number. In this implementation, you start with $100 and place bets prior to rolling two dice.</p>

<p>Bet amounts can be in dollars and cents. 'Q' will quit the game.</p>

<p>I wrote this game as a final for my introductory college Java course. This opportunity showcased my understanding of various Java features, including loops, user-defined classes, objects, the Random class, and having logic in different classes.</p>
